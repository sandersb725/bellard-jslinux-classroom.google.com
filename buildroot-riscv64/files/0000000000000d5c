NAME
    tan - trigonometric tangent

SYNOPSIS
    tan(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		real
    eps		nonzero real, defaults to epsilon()

    return	real

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the tangent of x to a multiple of eps, with error less
    in absolute value than .75 * eps.

EXAMPLE
    ; print tan(1, 1e-5), tan(1, 1e-10), tan(1, 1e-15), tan(1, 1e-20)
    1.55741 1.5574077247 1.557407724654902 1.55740772465490223051

LIMITS
    unlike sin and cos, x must be real
    eps > 0

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qtan(NUMBER *x, NUMBER *eps)

SEE ALSO
    sin, cos, sec, csc, cot, epsilon
