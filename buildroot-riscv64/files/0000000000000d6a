    With one arg, epsilon(eps) returns the current epsilon value
    and sets the stored epsilon value to eps.

    The stored epsilon value is used as default value for eps in
    the functions appr(x, eps, rnd), sqrt(x, eps, rnd), etc.

EXAMPLE
    ; oldeps = epsilon(1e-6)
    ; print epsilon(), sqrt(2), epsilon(1e-4), sqrt(2), epsilon(oldeps)
    ; .000001 1.414214 .000001 1.4142 .0001
