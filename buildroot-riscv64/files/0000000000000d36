NAME
    atanh - inverse hyperbolic tangent

SYNOPSIS
    atanh(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		real
    eps		nonzero real, defaults to epsilon()

    return	real

DESCRIPTION
    Returns the atanh of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    atanh(x) is the real number v for which tanh(v) = x.  It is given by

		atanh(x) = ln((1 + x)/(1 - x))/2

EXAMPLE
    ; print atanh(.5,1e-5), atanh(.5,1e-10), atanh(.5,1e-15), atanh(.5,1e-20)
    .54931 .5493061443 .549306144334055 .5493061443340548457

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qatanh(NUMBER *x, NUMBER *eps)
