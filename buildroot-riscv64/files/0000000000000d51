NAME
    acsch - inverse hyperbolic cosecant

SYNOPSIS
    acsch(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		nonzero real
    eps		nonzero real, defaults to epsilon()

    return	real

DESCRIPTION
    Returns the acsch of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    acsch(x) is the real number v for which csch(v) = x.  It is given by

		acsch(x) = ln((1 + sqrt(1 + x^2))/x)


EXAMPLE
    ; print acsch(2, 1e-5), acsch(2, 1e-10), acsch(2, 1e-15), acsch(2, 1e-20)
    .48121 .4812118251 .481211825059603 .4812118250596034475

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qacsch(NUMBER *x, NUMBER *eps)
