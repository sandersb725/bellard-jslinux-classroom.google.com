NAME
    cos - cosine

SYNOPSIS
    cos(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		number (real or complex)
    eps		nonzero real, defaults to epsilon()

    return	number

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the cosine of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

EXAMPLE
    ; print cos(1, 1e-5), cos(1, 1e-10), cos(1, 1e-15), cos(1, 1e-20)
    .5403 .5403023059 .54030230586814 .5403023058681397174

    ; print cos(2 + 3i, 1e-5), cos(2 + 3i, 1e-10)
    -4.18963-9.10923i -4.189625691-9.1092278938i

    ; pi = pi(1e-20)
    ; print cos(pi/3, 1e-10), cos(pi/2, 1e-10), cos(pi, 1e-10)
    .5 0 -1

LIMITS
    none
