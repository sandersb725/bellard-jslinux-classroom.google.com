/*
 * Usage:
 *
 *       From the shell:
 *
 *               ./square
 *               cat file | ./square
 *               echo "123" | ./square
 *
 *       Within calc:
 *
 *               > read square
 *
 *  With input from a terminal, there is no prompt but each non-empty
 *  line of input is evaluated as a calc expression and if it can be
 *  calculated, the square of the value of that expression is displayed.
 *  Execution stops when an empty line is input.
 *
 *  From the shell:
 *
 *       ./square
 *
 *  The following shows lines of input followed by output:
 *
 *       1234
 *               1522756
 *       ln(2)
 *               ~.48045301391820142467
 *       config("mode","frac"), bernoulli(10)
 *               25/4356
 *       config("mode", "hex"), 0xff
 *               0xfe01
